#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Holds invariants 1 and 2 of CLAUDE.md: page metadata is measured at publish,
# and the machine-readable claims move with the copy.
#
# This is the public face of the business. A truncated title in a search result
# is the first thing a stranger sees, and a contradictory pair of robots
# directives is resolved by somebody else's algorithm, not by us.
#
# WHAT IT KNOWS ABOUT THIS SITE, because a check that does not know its domain
# produces a confident wrong number:
#
#   Content pages       must carry a title within 70 characters and a
#                       description between 25 and 160.
#   Redirect pages      carry a canonical and a refresh, and legitimately have
#                       no description. /enterprise and /products are these.
#   Generated output    /demo is a built single-page app. Its head is produced
#                       by a bundler, not authored here, so measuring its copy
#                       measures the bundler.
#
# The first version of this check counted three pages as failures. All three
# were the two redirects and the built app.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE. og:description deliberately differs from the meta
# description on every page here: the search snippet is held under 160 and the
# social card is allowed to run longer. Requiring them to match would be
# requiring a mistake.
#
# This file is the ONE copy of this check.
