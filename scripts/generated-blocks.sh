#
# Fails when a page's generated blocks are stale, or when a page has none
# because no generator has ever heard of it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Five tools in tools/ write into these pages: the footer, the top bar, the
# visible FAQ, the JSON-LD, and the markdown twins with the llms.txt index.
# Every one of them keeps a hand-written list of which pages it writes to, and
# nothing compared those five lists with each other or with the pages on disk.
#
# WHAT THAT COST, both found on 2026-08-29 and both months old:
#
#   agent-tooling-compared.html was published on 2026-08-11 and appeared in
#   NONE of the five lists, though its own commit message said it was "listed
#   in all seven places". Its footer was three categories out of date. Its
#   markdown twin, which is served at it-rat.com/agent-tooling-compared.md, was
#   still publishing the competitor comparison table and a section headed
#   "Where they are plainly better than us" a day after both were taken off the
#   page itself on Yurii's instruction. A generated file nobody regenerates is
#   worse than a hand-written one, because everybody assumes it is current.
#
#   services/scopyx.html was published on 2026-08-10 and was the one indexable
#   page on this site with no JSON-LD at all, sitting in the sitemap beside
#   fourteen pages that had it.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#
#   A. Coverage, which is about pages no generator knows.
#      Every page outside demo/ that is not noindex carries a canonical, a
#      JSON-LD block and a sitemap entry; every page in the STACK registry
#      carries a markdown twin.
#
#   B. Freshness, which is about pages they know and have not written since.
#      Copies every tracked file to a temporary directory, runs all five
#      generators there, and requires that they change nothing. A generator is
#      idempotent by design, so anything it would rewrite is drift.
#
# WHY B COPIES THE TREE
#
# A gate must not rewrite the thing it is judging. Running the generators in
# place would "fix" the drift it is meant to report, and the run after it would
# be green with nobody the wiser.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK
#
# Whether the generated text is any good, or whether a page SHOULD have a FAQ.
# Sphere is exempt from the twin because it is not in the STACK registry, and
# that exemption states its own reason: llms.txt is the stack's index for
# machine readers, and Sphere's first sentence is that it is not the stack.
