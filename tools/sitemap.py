"""Write sitemap.xml, with every lastmod taken from git rather than from memory.

Until 2026-08-29 this file was maintained by hand. It carried three dates,
2026-07-26, 2026-08-03 and 2026-08-10, for a site whose pages had been edited
on the 28th and the 29th, and it had gone stale the ordinary way: a page is
edited, the sitemap is not, and nothing anywhere notices.

WHAT LASTMOD IS ALLOWED TO MEAN

It is a claim about the page, so it has to be about the page. The naive answer,
the date of the last commit that touched the file, is wrong here in a way that
matters: a footer regeneration writes all thirty pages in one commit, and a
sitemap where everything changed today is a sitemap a crawler learns to ignore.

So this asks a narrower question. It strips the blocks that other generators
own, the footer, the top bar, the JSON-LD, the corridor rail and the asset
version query, and then walks the file's history backwards while the stripped
content still matches what is on disk. The oldest commit that still matches is
the commit where the page BECAME what it is, and its date is the lastmod.

WHICH WAY THIS ERRS, SAID OUT LOUD

Towards dates that are too new, never too old. A blob from before a marker
existed cannot have that block stripped out of it, so it compares as different
and the walk stops there. A page whose content really has not moved since July
may therefore be dated to the day its footer markers arrived. That is a claim
that the page changed more recently than it did, which costs a crawl; the
opposite error would hide a change, which costs a reader.

WHERE THE CLOCK COMES IN, AND WHY IT HAS TO

A page whose content matches no commit is one that has been edited and not
committed yet, and it takes today's date. That is the only clock in here, and
it is what lets the tool agree with itself across the commit that introduces a
change: run this, commit the page and the sitemap together, and the next run
finds that commit at the head of the history and computes the same date the
file already holds. Dating it from the newest existing commit instead would be
deterministic and would fail the gate on every single content edit, because the
commit being made is the one that has not happened yet.

So the output is stable for any committed tree, which is what CI and the gate
see, and moves with the day only while an edited page is still uncommitted.
