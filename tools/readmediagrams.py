"""Turn each room's architecture diagram into a standalone animated SVG.

Every service page already carries a hand-drawn schematic in the site's own
visual language. On the site it is animated by `assets/diagram.js`; in a GitHub
README there is no JavaScript, so the flow has to be carried by SMIL inside the
file itself. This lifts the diagram out of the page, wraps it so it renders
standalone (`xmlns`, an opaque background so it stays legible on a light GitHub
theme, a title), and animates the arrows: a coloured pulse marches along every
wire, and the service's own box breathes in its accent.

The output is one file per service under assets/img/readme/diagrams/, copied
from there into each service repo's README.
